Rule1	test_lower <= x <= test_upper	peak_lower <= x <= peak_upper	PASS
Rule2	(test_lower <= x <= test_upper)	not (peak_lower <= x < peak_upper) and (peak_lower < test_lower)	PASS
Rule3	(test_lower <= x <= test_upper)	not (peak_lower <= x < peak_upper)	The read length after subsampling doesnot match the input plasmid size
Rule4	not (peak_lower <= x <= peak_upper)	(peak_lower <= test_lower < peak_upper)	The read length after subsampling doesnot match the input plasmid size but matching with readlength after assembly
Rule5	not (peak_lower <= x <= peak_upper)	not (test_lower <= x <= test_upper)	FAIL
Rule6	(peak_lower <= x <= peak_upper)	not (test_lower <= x <= test_upper)	Rerun
